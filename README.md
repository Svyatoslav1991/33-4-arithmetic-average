Task 4. Arithmetic mean in an array

What should be done
Implement a template function for calculating the arithmetic mean in an array of scalar numbers of an arbitrary type.
It can be int, double, float and so on.
Array data is entered and the result is output through a standard console.

Recommendations
For simplicity, you can implement the count in a fixed-length array.
It is also recommended to implement the array data input function as a template function.
